## Installing dependencies

To install dependencies run:

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt


## Step 1:

Run `git clone https://github.com/seanlobo/fb-msg-mining.git` where you would like to clone the project


## Step 2:

Request a copy of your Facebook data:

Go to Facebook and click on Settings -> "Download a copy" link near the middle of the page.
You'll need to put in your facebook password in order to request the download, and you should
recieve a confirmation email from facebook immediately, sent to the email you used when signing up.
**It can less than an hour or take up to a week to get your archive, and you only have 24 hours
before the link sent to you expires, so check carefully!**


## Step 3:

When you get an email with the download link, use the link emailed to you by facebook 
to download a copy of your data **within 24 hours**


## Step 4:

Extract the zip you get and move the `html` folder inside the project folder


## Step 5:

Run `python3 setup.py` and follow prompts
